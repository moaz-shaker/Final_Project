# Ngrok Deployment Setup Guide

## Prerequisites
1. Install Ngrok: https://ngrok.com/download
2. Create a free Ngrok account: https://ngrok.com/signup
3. Get your authtoken from: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/32v0bEHowJCEOfqcHJjGWPKl1fY_5vuuFdhJ52nYiw5tNWZ3z

## Setup Steps

### 1. Install Ngrok
```bash
# Download and install Ngrok
# Follow instructions on https://ngrok.com/download 

# Authenticate 
ngrok authtoken 32v0bEHowJCEOfqcHJjGWPKl1fY_5vuuFdhJ52nYiw5tNWZ3z
```

### 2. Run the Streamlit App Locally
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd Heart_Disease_Project

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run ui/app.py
```

### 3. Deploy with Ngrok
```bash
# In a new terminal, run Ngrok to expose the Streamlit app
ngrok http 8501

# Ngrok will provide a public URL like: https://abc123.ngrok.io
```

### 4. Access the Application
- Copy the public URL provided by Ngrok
- Share this URL with others to access your application
- The URL will remain active as long as the Ngrok process is running

### Troubleshooting
1. **Port 8501 already in use**: Change the port in streamlit run command
2. **Ngrok not working**: Check your internet connection and authtoken
3. **App not loading**: Ensure Streamlit is running on the correct port
